# Please do this before submitting: #
- [ ] check for already solved issues
- [ ] try restarting Sublime Text

# Please state the following: #
- Sublime Text version: `<here>`
- which system are you on: `<here>`

# What I need to help you: #
- The best way is to provide a minimal example that illustrates the issue in a small repo on GitHub. This way, I can probably run it on my machine and solve it locally.
- If you can't create it, please provide a full log output from the plugin. Without it I cannot do anything. To capture the log:
    + set `"verbose": true` in plugin settings
    + restart Sublime Text
    + open the file or do the action that causes trouble
    + open console with <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>`</kbd>
    + copy *full* output to a text file and link it to this issue
